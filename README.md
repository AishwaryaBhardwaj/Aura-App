# 🌸 Aura: The Soul-Matching Sanctuary

Aura is a high-end, intentional dating experience designed to move beyond the "swipe fatigue" of modern apps. Built with a **Zen-inspired Soft Pastel** aesthetic, Aura focuses on "Soul to Social" alignment through AI-driven personality fragments and intentional conversation.

## ✨ Key Features
* **The Soul Interview**: A 3-question shuffled voice interview that builds your unique 'Persona Fragment' (e.g., The Dreamer, The Architect).
* **Hobby Canvas**: A digital art space where users describe their favorite Sunday morning to generate interactive Vibe Tags.
* **The Daily Trio**: A curated feed of 3 intentional matches per day, featuring a **Slow Reveal** shimmer-blur that only clears as connections deepen.
* **Intentionality Bubbles**: Users clearly state their path—from Marriage-Minded to Casual Magic—to ensure goals are always aligned.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
Inspired by mindfulness and meditation apps, Aura utilizes:
* **Palette**: Blush Pink (#FDE2E4) and Lace Cream (#FFF1E6) with Soft Coral accents.
* **Experience**: Glassmorphic cards, hand-drawn artistic icons, and animated "Aura Guide" elements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: React Native / Expo (Managed Workflow)
* **Styling**: NativeWind / Styled Components
* **Animations**: React Native Reanimated & Gesture Handler
* **Backend**: Firebase / Google Cloud (Real-time Chat & Match Algorithms)
